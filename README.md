# CategorizeOnce - Automatically categorize transactions without giving away your data

## Features

- **Private**: Data is processed locally
- **Smart**: Creates mapping rules for payer/payee as you categorize them and stores in your browser's localStorage
- **Versatile**: Use double colons to create subcategories
- **Easy migration**: Create mapping rules from your previously categorized bank statements
- **Flexible**: Works with most bank statements as long as they're CSV files

## How it works

1. Import a bank statement.
2. Categorize your transactions.
3. Export the result as a CSV file.
4. CategorizeOnce creates mapping rules for each payee/payer as you categorize them.
   Next time, it will automatically categorize them.
